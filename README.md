# onWebMyBoardGame

this is my first project i did it as soon as i learned the basics of javascript and the DOM, it's a game inspired by a board game that i used to play in my native country (that's why it's in spanish), although it only uses the basics of programming, css and html, it was a challenge for my i had to create all the logic of the game from scratch and create all the corresponding images and animations.

postscript:

(to all programmers who read the code, my apologies I know that the code is a bit messy and I have to admit that, I repeat on some occasions, just remember that it was my first project and I was learning to program thanks, wait for my next projects to judge me ðŸ˜‰. Thanks
